difficult peace mission to &lt;-Syria-&gt;, prepared to hold more talks  
with President Bashar al-Assad on Sunday as Syrian &lt;-forces-&gt; pursued  
a drive to crush &lt;-rebel-&gt; bastions in the northwest. 
  Annan, joint envoy of the United Nations and Arab League,  
appeared to make little headway on Saturday in a "candid and  
comprehensive" meeting with Assad, who blamed the bloodshed on  
"terrorists" seeking to destabilise &lt;-Syria-&gt;. 
  The Syrian state news agency SANA said he told Annan &lt;-Syria-&gt; would  
help in "any honest effort to find a solution" to a year-long  
&lt;-conflict-&gt; that has cost thousands of lives. 
  But there was no sign he had accepted what a U.N. spokesman said  
were Annan's proposals for a ceasefire, humanitarian aid access,  
release of &lt;-detainees-&gt; and a political dialogue. 
  Syrians involved in a popular uprising against Assad say there  
can be no meaningful dialogue with a leader who has inflicted  
such &lt;-violence-&gt; and suffering on his own people. Annan met Syrian  
religious leaders, including the mufti, the senior Sunni Muslim  
authority, and the Greek Orthodox Christian patriarch, on Sunday.  
A U.N. spokesman said he would see Assad again before leaving for  
the Gulf state of Qatar. 
  Annan's mission has coincided with a Syrian military offensive  
against opposition strongholds in the northwest. 
  Three &lt;-soldiers-&gt; and a civilian were &lt;-killed-&gt; in &lt;-fighting-&gt; in the  
village of Janoudiya in Idlib province on Sunday morning,  
according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. 
  Its British-based director, Rami Abdulrahman, said Idlib city was  
quieter after Saturday's tank-led &lt;-assault-&gt;, suggesting that  
outgunned &lt;-rebels-&gt; had withdrawn or decided not to confront the  
army, which has launched an offensive in the northwest after  
recapturing &lt;-insurgent-&gt; strongholds in the city of Homs last week. 
  The Observatory said 39 civilians, including 25 in Idlib  
province, were &lt;-killed-&gt; on Saturday, along with 39 &lt;-rebels-&gt; and 20  
government &lt;-soldiers-&gt;, giving an overall death toll of 98. ARABS

  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who met Annan in Cairo on  
Friday, told the Arab League his country was "not protecting any  
regime", but did not believe the Syrian &lt;-crisis-&gt; could be blamed on  
one side alone. 
  He called for a ceasefire and humanitarian aid access, but Qatar  
and Saudi Arabia sharply criticised Moscow's stance. 
  Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, who has  
led calls for Assad to be isolated and for Syrian &lt;-rebels-&gt; to be  
armed, said a ceasefire was not enough. Syrian leaders must be  
held to account and political &lt;-prisoners-&gt; freed, he declared. 
  Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal said shortcomings in the  
U.N. Security Council, where Russia and China have twice vetoed  
resolutions on &lt;-Syria-&gt;, had allowed the &lt;-killing-&gt; to go on. 
  Their position, he said, "gave the Syrian regime a licence to  
extend its brutal practices against the Syrian people". 
  Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which are both ruled by autocrats and  
espouse a strict version of Sunni Islam, are improbable champions  
of democracy in &lt;-Syria-&gt;. Riyadh has an interest in seeing Assad  
fall because this could weaken its Shi'ite regional rival Iran,  
which has been allied with &lt;-Syria-&gt; since 1980. 
  International rifts have paralysed action on &lt;-Syria-&gt;, with Russia  
and China opposing Western and Arab calls for Assad, who  
inherited power from his father nearly 12 years ago, to quit. 
  The United States has drafted a fresh U.N. Security Council  
resolution, but Washington and Paris have said they are not  
optimistic it will be accepted. 
  Despite their differences, Lavrov and Arab ministers said they  
had agreed on the need for an end to &lt;-violence-&gt; in &lt;-Syria-&gt;. 
  They also called for unbiased monitoring of events there,  
opposition to foreign intervention, delivery of humanitarian aid  
and support for Annan's peace efforts. 
  But the exiled opposition Syrian National Council ruled out talks  
while Assad is in power. 
  "Negotiations can never take place between the &lt;-victim-&gt; and  
&lt;-torturer-&gt;: Assad and his entourage must step down as a condition  
before starting any serious negotiations," it said. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will meet Lavrov in New  
York on Monday when the Security Council holds a special meeting  
on Arab revolts, with &lt;-Syria-&gt; likely to be in focus. countryside countryside
